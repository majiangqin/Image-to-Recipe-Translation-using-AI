Information theoretic arguments show that perplexity (the logarithm of which is the familiar entropy) is a more appropriate measure of equivalent choice. It too has certain weaknesses which we discuss. We show that perplexity can also be applied to languages having no obvious statistical description, since an entropy‐maximizing probability assignment can be found for any finite‐state grammar. Table I shows perplexity values for some well‐known speech recognition tasks.
